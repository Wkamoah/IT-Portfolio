## üìö Learning Journey & Problem-Solving

### Virtualization Boot Challenge (23.10.2025)
**Challenge:** Initial DC01 VM failed to boot during Windows Server deployment  
**Discovery:** VirtualBox requires explicit boot configuration from ISO files  
**Solution:** 
- Diagnosed boot order settings in VM configuration
- Created DC02 VM with corrected boot priority ‚Üí successful installation
- Applied solution to original DC01 VM
**Outcome:** Both domain controllers now operational, deeper understanding of virtualization platform

### Client vs Server OS Discovery (31.10.2025)
**Challenge:** Attempted to install Active Directory on Windows 10 VMs (DC01/DC02)  
**Discovery:** Windows 10 is a client OS and cannot run server roles like Active Directory Domain Services  
**Solution:** 
- Researched differences between client and server operating systems
- Identified the need for Windows Server 2022 for domain controller functionality
- Documented the learning process and created recovery plan
**Outcome:** Deeper understanding of OS fundamentals and proper lab environment planning

### Freshdesk Workflow Optimization (01.11.2025)
**Challenge:** 
- Ticket documentation for LAB# 001,002,003 and 004 lacked professional structure.
- No Freshdesk Tutorial for in-depth knowledge of the features of Freshdesk
  
**Discovery:** Professional IT support requires systematic ticket management for tracking and accountability.  

**Solution:** 
- Watched a Freshdesk tutorial video on youtube, took notes and tried some features.
- Video link =  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MUFKgNuN84
  
**Key Learnings:** 
- Freshdesk can do automatic ticket assignment using a "Round Robin" system to evenly distribute work among agents.
- I can add automatic escalation rules to alert managers if a ticket remains unassigned for a set time, ensuring nothing gets forgotten.
- Freshdesk can track team performance metrics on its dashboard, like unresolved tickets per group and average response times.
- I can set different agent access levels (Global, Group, Restricted) and track their availability status (e.g., Working, Away).
- I can use private internal notes on tickets for team communication that the customer cannot see.
- Freshdesk allows you to use a custom professional email domain (e.g., support@winfredlab.com) instead of a generic address.
- I can customize ticket fields and dropdowns (like Type, Priority, Source) to fit my lab's specific workflow.
