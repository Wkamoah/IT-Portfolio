## 📚 Learning Journey & Problem-Solving

### Virtualization Boot Challenge
**Challenge:** Initial DC01 VM failed to boot during Windows Server deployment  
**Discovery:** VirtualBox requires explicit boot configuration from ISO files  
**Solution:** 
- Diagnosed boot order settings in VM configuration
- Created DC02 VM with corrected boot priority → successful installation
- Applied solution to original DC01 VM
**Outcome:** Both domain controllers now operational, deeper understanding of virtualization platform

### Client vs Server OS Discovery
**Challenge:** Attempted to install Active Directory on Windows 10 VMs (DC01/DC02)  
**Discovery:** Windows 10 is a client OS and cannot run server roles like Active Directory Domain Services  
**Solution:** 
- Researched differences between client and server operating systems
- Identified the need for Windows Server 2022 for domain controller functionality
- Documented the learning process and created recovery plan
**Outcome:** Deeper understanding of OS fundamentals and proper lab environment planning
