## 🛠️ Featured Project: Multilingual AI Support System

**Workflow automation tool for technical support teams handling multilingual tickets (RU/EN).**

**Challenge**  
Language barriers in Russian tickets slow response times and risk miscommunication.

**Solution**  
- **Controlled Translation:** Russian technical tickets → English with strict glossary enforcement  
- **Knowledge Retrieval:** Vector search against internal documentation to suggest solutions  
- **Draft Generation:** Structured replies with root cause analysis and next steps  
- **Human Review:** Specialist dashboard for editing before final response  

**Technical Stack**  
React frontend, Python/FastAPI backend (planned), documentation-driven retrieval workflow

**Current Status**  
Functional prototype with documented workflow and mock API, designed for production deployment

## 📚 Troubleshooting Case Studies

### Case 1: Domain Controller Boot Recovery
**Date:** Oct 2025 | **Environment:** VirtualBox Lab  

**Problem:** DC01 VM failed to boot during Windows Server deployment, halting AD lab setup.  
**Diagnostic Process:** Checked boot sequence, ISO configuration, and tested alternate VM.  
**Resolution:** Reconfigured VirtualBox boot headers; applied solution to original VM.  
**Outcome:** Two operational domain controllers; strengthened hypervisor boot knowledge.

### Case 2: Client vs. Server OS Architecture
**Date:** Oct 2025  

**Problem:** Attempted AD DS install on Windows 10 VMs → failed.  
**Investigation:** Windows 10 cannot host server roles; AD DS requires Windows Server.  
**Resolution:** Rebuilt environment on Windows Server 2022; redeployed domain controllers.  
**Outcome:** Functional AD environment with DNS/DHCP; solid OS fundamentals.

### Case 3: Dell Laptop Boot & Hardware Diagnostics
**Date:** Nov 2025  

**Problem:** Boot failures + automatic power-on.  
**Diagnosis:** GPT/UEFI mismatch and physically stuck power button.  
**Resolution:** Configured UEFI boot, verified GPT compatibility, isolated hardware fault.  
**Outcome:** Multi-layer issue resolved; reinforced firmware + hardware troubleshooting.

### Case 4: Lenovo Microphone Driver Recovery
**Date:** Nov 2025  

**Problem:** Microphone detected but no audio input across apps.  
**Diagnosis:** System-level driver corruption, not app-specific.  
**Resolution:** Installed pending Windows Updates with driver patches.  
**Outcome:** Restored full audio functionality; reinforced driver-level troubleshooting.

### Case 5: Freshdesk Workflow Implementation
**Date:** Nov 2025  

**Challenge:** Lab tickets lacked structure; ITSM workflow needed.  
**Implementation:**  
- Configured Freshdesk with Round Robin assignment & escalation rules  
- Customized fields, priorities, workflow stages, and internal notes  
- Integrated performance dashboard & professional email domain  

**Outcome:** Professional-grade ticketing workflow operational; lab documentation now aligned with ITSM best practices.
