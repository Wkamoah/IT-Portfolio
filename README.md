## 📚 Learning Journey & Problem-Solving

### Virtualization Boot Challenge
**Challenge:** Initial DC01 VM failed to boot during Windows Server deployment  
**Discovery:** VirtualBox requires explicit boot configuration from ISO files  
**Solution:** 
- Diagnosed boot order settings in VM configuration
- Created DC02 VM with corrected boot priority → successful installation
- Applied solution to original DC01 VM
**Outcome:** Both domain controllers now operational, deeper understanding of virtualization platform
